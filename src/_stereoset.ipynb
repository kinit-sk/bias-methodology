The second axis shows how more probable the keyword is. We can see that there is not a strong relation, i.e. the model is not choosing the more frequent word. Additionaly, the more frequent words are not predominately used in the first sentence. Contrast this with our dataset, where we choose more frequent word for the first sentence and the model is choosing these words often as well. "
